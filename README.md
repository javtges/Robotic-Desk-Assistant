# ME495 Homework 3
## James Avtges

This homework assignemnt is broken down into two major components:

- Constructing and controlling a differential drive robot
- Path planning for a 4 DOF robot arm (Interbotix PX100)

### Differential Drive Robot:

The objective from this component is to make a urdf to construct a model of a differential drive robot, import it into a custom gazebo world, and command it to do some flips and other fun behavior.

### Arm Path Planning

The objective here is to use the Interbotix PX100 arm to follow a series of waypoints in RViz, gazebo, and on a real robot. This involves experimentation with path-planning around obstacles and basic picking up of objects in simulation and in the real world.
