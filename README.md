# Robotic Desk Assistant
## James Avtges

The goal for this project was to gain experience with object detection, stereo imaging, and gesture recognition in the context of programming a robotic desk assistant.

For anyone with a cluttered desk or a large workspace, a small robotic arm may be a useful companion to help with organization or to extend oneâ€™s reach. To that end, the overall goal is to use computer vision to accomplish the following tasks:
 - Recognize objects in the workspace (on a desk),
 - Determine in three dimensions where the user points their index finger, and
 - Control the arm to pick up and manipulate objects that are pointed to.
